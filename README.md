Older customers tend to spend more compared to younger ones, while discount engagement varies significantly across age groups.

# Recommendations:

Targeted Promotions: Focus marketing efforts on couples and singles, especially for wine products. Develop campaigns to encourage discount purchases among younger customers.

Loyalty Programs: Enhance loyalty programs for middle-aged and older customers to retain and incentivize their purchases.

Personalized Offers : Use targeted discounts and personalized offers based on age segments to increase overall purchase frequency and engagement.

Educational Content: Provide educational content to help less educated customers make informed purchasing decisions.

Channel-Specific Strategies: Enhance in-store promotions for couples and widows. Increase catalog marketing efforts for widows. Implement a balanced mix of online and in-store promotions for divorced and single individuals.

Age-Specific Campaigns: Increase web and catalog marketing efforts towards older customers. Improve the website interface and online promotions to boost web purchases among middle-aged customers.
